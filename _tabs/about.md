## Welcome to My World

Hello there! I'm **Kaleb Southerland**, a tech enthusiast and professional with a zeal for quality and efficiency in the digital realm. Since June 2020, I've been part of the team at Pensacola Christian College, where I serve as a QA Engineer and Web Developer. With a solid foundation in QA principles certified by the ASTQB, I navigate the complexities of software testing with a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence.

## The Professional Journey

My professional entry into technology began with my academic pursuit—a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Software Engineering. It was during my undergraduate years that I took the helm as president of my fraternity and led a five-person team to develop a 2D pixel art game in Unity, sharpening my leadership and programming skills.

Those formative years set the stage for my career, where I began in Quality Assurance, eventually becoming the linchpin of the department. My responsibilities are as diverse as they are intricate, ranging from developing web-based dashboards to managing database schemas and writing scripts that ensure our institution's digital presence is both cutting-edge and reliable.

## Community and Leadership

My college years were not only a testament to my academic pursuits but also to my leadership and dedication to community service. As president of my fraternity and team lead on a major senior project, I demonstrated a capacity to guide teams and projects to successful outcomes. Additionally, my frequent participation in a Christian service group, where we reached out to minister to the local community, further enriched my skills in leadership and collaboration. These experiences did not just hone my abilities; they deeply instilled in me the value of active and empathetic engagement with those around me.
